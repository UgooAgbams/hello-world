# hello-world

Hey there

My name is UgoChukwu Agbams. I'm a nob in the world of coding, although I didn't start my journey of coding on an early age of my life, but I'm commited to archive a result and make a different in my world.

This is my first commit per say. Although there have been some before this one, but here, I'm taking things one step at a time, applying what i'm learning through following a tutorial.
